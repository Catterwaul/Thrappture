# Thrappture

* Property wrappers cannot throw. 
* `Optional` and `Result` are not property wrappers.

This package imagines what life would be like if those statements were not true. ðŸ¤©

## Dependency 

Thrappture is in the "Major Version Zero" phase, allowing for rapid development based on community feedback. 

Refer to [this semantic versioning reference](https://docs.swift.org/package-manager/PackageDescription/PackageDescription.html#version) for the following. 

Until reaching 1.0.0â€¦
1. ***Minor*** releases will use the rules laid out for post-1.x ***major*** releases.
2. ***Patch*** releases will use the rules laid out for post-1.x ***minor*** versions, along with standard patch rules.
 
This means you'll need to use the "Up to Next ***Minor*** Version" dependency rule if you need to avoid breaking changes.

While you can consider this as legally valid as any other use of the MIT license, it does not indicate that we philosophically endorse the use of this license, or any software license we currently know of.
